I find that the earlier rounds of stress tests induced high-exposure banks to sharply reduce credit limits, especially to ex-ante risky borrowers.

We document significant heterogeneity in the pass-through of the bank liquidity shocks with banks cutting credit limits by more for credit-constrained consumers (e.g., lower credit-score and higher credit utilization consumers).

One, using an expanded bankruptcy database we validate the superior forecasting performance of Shumway's (2001) model as opposed to Altman (1968) and Zmijewski (1984). Two, we demonstrate the importance of including industry effects in hazard rate estimation. Industry groupings are shown to significantly affect both the intercept and slope coefficients in the forecasting equations. Three, we extend the hazard rate model to apply to financial firms and monthly observation intervals. Due to data limitations, most of the existing literature employs only yearly observations. We show that bankruptcy prediction is markedly improved using monthly observation intervals.

Wages of hourly workers, especially part-time hourly workers, decrease significantly. This decrease is driven by a drop in the number of hours worked. We observe a U-shaped pattern in which both young and old workers experience a sharper decrease in wage income. Consequently, in these counties, there is a decrease in credit scores and an increase in delinquency for retail workers that have higher prior credit utilization. Using sales and employment data for 3.2 million stores, we find that retail stores in counties around fulfillment centers experience a reduction in sales and in their number of employees. Further, there is a decrease in entry and an increase in exits for stores in the retail sector, with small and young retail stores exiting at a higher rate.

Consistent with higher bank risk-taking in later rounds, cards issued by highly-exposed banks have a higher ex-post likelihood of default. Additionally, I document that more affected non-prime borrowers are more likely to default subsequently, and that this effect is markedly pronounced for the low-income and less-educated consumer segments.
