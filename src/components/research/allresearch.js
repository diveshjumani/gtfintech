    abstract:"Using a dynamic model of strategic bargaining between equity and debt holders following default, we analyze the impact of shareholder bargaining power and debt overhang on optimal investment and strategic default. Our empirical tests utilize a new measure of the debt overhang wedge based on default probabilities generated from a hazard model for bankruptcy. Consistent with the theoretical predictions, bondholder (shareholder) ownership concentration ceteris paribus enhances (weakens) the overhang wedge and dampens (increases) capital investment. We identify novel ownership-structure-related factors in firm-level capital investment and document how post-default shareholder bargaining power alleviates the underinvestment problem caused by debt overhang.",
    keytakeaway:"We identify novel ownership-structure-related factors in firm-level capital investment and document how post-default shareholder bargaining power alleviates the underinvestment problem caused by debt overhang."

    abstract:'We study the dynamics of borrower reputation in bank loan markets following revelations of financial misreporting by the borrower. Misreporting firms pay greater loan spreads than matched firms for at least six years following revelation of the misreporting, and there is no evidence of a downward trend in the misreporting premium. Following revelation, misreporting firms are more likely to engage in various actions to potentially rebuild their reputations, but even firms that engage in multiple actions continue to pay greater loan spreads for at least six years. Our results suggest that misreporting causes long-lasting and costly reputation losses that firms find very difficult or prohibitively costly to restore. This paper was accepted by Wei Jiang, finance.',

    abstract: "Using proprietary account-level data from a major credit bureau, I examine the impact of stress tests on bank risk-taking in the U.S. consumer credit card market. I decompose credit supply and demand effects by exploiting credit card--level data on limits and balances matched to both consumers and banks. For the same consumer, I examine the lending response of banks experiencing higher stress-test induced capital requirements (i.e., high-exposure banks) relative to less-exposed banks. I find that the earlier rounds of stress tests induced high-exposure banks to sharply reduce credit limits, especially to ex-ante risky borrowers. In contrast, more exposed banks in later rounds have increased limits for risky consumers. Consistent with higher bank risk-taking in later rounds, cards issued by highly-exposed banks have a higher ex-post likelihood of default. Additionally, I document that more affected non-prime borrowers are more likely to default subsequently, and that this effect is markedly pronounced for the low-income and less-educated consumer segments. My findings suggest that stress-test induced increases in capital requirements can encourage higher bank risk-taking, with distributional consequences for consumer creditworthiness.",
